-I used slug as charfield in previous blog project,
But now, i wanted to automatically generate slug and not 
make manually write it so i added.
models.SlugField(unique=True)

    def save(self):
        self.slug = slugify(self.title)
        super(BlogPost, self).save()
    class   Meta:
        ordering    =   ('-datetime')
